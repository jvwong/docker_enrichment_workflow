# Docker enrichment

## Introduction

This repository is part of the [Pathway Commons](http://www.pathwaycommons.org/) [Guide](http://pathwaycommons.github.io/guide/) workflow for [Pathway enrichment].

The code here runs a [docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/jvwong/) preloaded with [RStudio](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/rstudio/) and the necessary [R/Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/) dependencies. The script `get_data.R` contains all the code required to source high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGS-OvCa) RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data generated by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) effort. This data is housed at the Genonomic Data Commons (GDC) data repository.

## Software requirements

- [Docker version](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/): version 1.12.3
